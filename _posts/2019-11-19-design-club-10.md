speakerTwoBio: You want your team to form like Voltron, but it’s a bit like a dog playing Jenga? Great teams are more than the sum of their parts, but to get there you need to create a work culture where everyone’s skills and knowledge can be freely shared. Nat will talk about the way Bulb is building content, design and research culture, bringing together people across disciplines to do their best work together.
